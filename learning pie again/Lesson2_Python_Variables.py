# In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:
# Example
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"

# Python has no command for declaring a variable.

"VARIABLES"
# Variables are containers for storing data values.
# Example
x = 5
y = "Ya boi" 
print(x)
print(y)

# Variables do not need to be declared with any particual type, and can even change type  after they have been set.
x = 4 # x is the type int
x = "mema" # x is now the type str
print(x)

"CASTING"
# if you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
# Example
x = str(3) # will be "3"
y = int(3) # will be 3
z = float(3) # will be 3.0
